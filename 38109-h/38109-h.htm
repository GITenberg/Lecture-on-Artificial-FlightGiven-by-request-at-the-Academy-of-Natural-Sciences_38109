<h2>SAILING IN THE AIR.</h2>

<hr />

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.&mdash;INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><i>Gentlemen of the Academy</i>:</p>

<p>The problem of artificial flight is of such great importance
to civilization; so interesting and fascinating,
not only to the student, but to every one; and it allows
us to indulge in such a wide field for speculation
as to the great changes which will be wrought by the
practical solution of it in the social, political and commercial
world, that I must beg of you to consider only
my good intentions in appearing before you, and pardon
my shortcomings as a lecturer. It is my first attempt,
and is simply undertaken to bring the subject
more understandingly before the public, that they may
assist, morally, and pecuniarily, the several inventors
who are wrestling with it more or less successfully&mdash;some
rather less. If only one inventor in a
hundred should meet with flattering results, the attention
bestowed upon all will be repaid a thousand fold
by that one's success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
The idea of sailing through the air in a flying machine
is not new, nor such an absurd one as is generally
supposed; and it is indeed important to investigate
and lay it before the public more directly than has
been done heretofore through the medium of great,
musty and long-winded volumes. If found to seem
practicable and feasible, it is for you, gentlemen, to see
that the future great State of California shall also be
ahead in this&mdash;one of the greatest and most important
inventions of the age&mdash;as she is, and has been in many
other things before.</p>

<p>The subject has really been taken hold of in a thorough
and scientific manner only the last few years; but
with such earnestness and scientific knowledge and intelligence,
not only by the foremost and principal society
for the advancement of the art&mdash;the Aeronautic
Society of Great Britain&mdash;to whom, really, the most
credit must fall&mdash;but in every civilized country; and so
much has been done already to prove, not only the
possibility but the absolute certainty of an early practical
solution of the problem, that soon we will see the
air traversed in all directions, by aspiring man. Many
seeming impossibilities of the present, need only time
and effort to become realities in the near future.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.&mdash;HISTORY AND FABLE.</h2>

<p>In turning our thoughts to History, reaching back
even into the mazy and wonderful ages of fable, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
that from time immemorial the great science of ærostation
has occupied the minds of philosophers and inventors.
There can be little doubt that it was known
and made use of in olden times in isolated cases, but
was again lost, like many other important inventions.</p>

<p>We are furnished with many interesting proofs of
this. Old Chinese, Arabian and Hindu fables give some
beautiful descriptions of ærial chariots, in which wizards,
princes and fairies sped over the fertile and populous
plains of their native country, disbursing good or
evil, according to their disposition, to the poor devils
crawling in the dust beneath them. The Jews had
their cherubim. The Assyrians have left us their
winged bulls; the Greeks, their Sphinxes; while the
Roman writers describe how that mythical personage,
Daedalus, a famous Athenian artificer, and builder of
the Cretan labyrinth, constructed wings with which he
flew across the Ægian Sea, to escape the resentment
of Minos. But his son, Icarus, undoubtedly of his
strength giving out, fell into the water and was drowned.
Their nation has bequeathed to us various bas-reliefs,
illustrative of what appear well-proportioned
wings.</p>

<p>Archytos, the great geometrician, made a wooden
dove that flew like a natural one, and the famous German
astronomer, John Mueller, who died suddenly in
Rome, at the age of forty, in 1476, and whose memory
was celebrated last month in Germany, constructed
an artificial eagle, which flew out to greet the Emperor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Charles V, when he visited Nuremberg. This
Mueller was more widely known by the assumed name
of &quot;Regiomontanus,&quot;&mdash;the &quot;Kingshiller&quot;&mdash;that is,
&quot;one from K&oelig;nigsberg,&quot; a small village in the heart of Germany;
the custom of the times being for learned men
to adopt the latin name of their birthplace. He invented
the almanac, and prepared the first astronomical
tables, by the aid of which mariners, who, up to
that late day could only make coasting voyages, were
enabled to trust themselves to the open sea, with some
degree of assurance; and Columbus was among the
earliest to use these tables, twenty years afterwards, on
his first discovery voyage to America.</p>

<p>Another German, a young watchmaker's apprentice,
constructed a flying machine, with which he, when
showing the same to his ignorant townspeople, flew
away to escape mobbing. His bones and pieces of the
machine were found some years afterward in a wild and isolated
part of the Black Forest. Towards the end of
the fifteenth century Giovanni Battista Dantes, of Perugia,
flew several times over the Thrasimenian Sea;
he certainly must have been at a considerable elevation,
for he fell on a church steeple and broke a leg. Another
account, particularly noticed in history, is that of
a man who flew high in the air in the City of Rome,
under the reign of Nero, but lost his life in the descent.</p>

<p>In &quot;Astra Castra,&quot; we read that soon after Bacon's
time, projects were instituted to train up children in the
exercise of flying with artificial wings, and considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
progress was made; by the combined effort of running
and flying they were enabled to skim over the surface,
as it were, with incredible speed. This same Roger Bacon,
an eminent philosopher of the thirteenth century,
and possessed of the very highest genius and ability,
whose ideas and knowledge, like Franklin's, were many
hundred years ahead of his age, descants, in one of his
works, in glowing language, on the practicability of
constructing engines that could navigate the air. He
accomplished wonderful things in his day, and was accused
of holding communion with the devil, who was
quite an important personage in those times. His writings
were interdicted, and himself locked up to prevent
closer acquaintanceship of his readers with the aforesaid
friend.</p>

<p>About the Confessor's time, a monk, Elmirus, in
Spain, flew often, by means of a pair of wings, many
miles from high elevations. Cuperus, in his treatise
on &quot;The Excellency of Man,&quot; contends that it is practicable
for human beings to attain the faculty of flying.
He asserts that Leonardo da Vinci, the great painter of
the &quot;Lord's Supper,&quot; and other highly prized works of
art, practiced it successfully. The reasoning of the
great John Wilkins, Lord Bishop of Chester, who
died in 1672, embodies the sentiments and principles
of all these on the subject even stronger. In his work
on &quot;Mechanical Motion,&quot; he treats expressly on artificial
flight, and conceives, in the sixth chapter, the framing
of such &quot;volitant automata&quot; very easy; and says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
that the time will come when men will call for their
wings when about to make a journey, as they do now
for their boots and spurs.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the &quot;Journal de Savans,&quot; of the 12th of
September, 1678, an account is given of one Besnier,
a locksmith of Sable, France, who succeeded in flying.
But as his machine was extremely primitive&mdash;the wings
consisting only of four rectangular surfaces, one at the
end of each of two poles, which passed over the shoulder
of the operator, and were worked alternately up
and down&mdash;the inventor could only avail himself of
their aid in progressively raising himself from one
hight to another, until an elevated position was reached,
when he could glide through the air a long distance.</p>

<p>Many more cases could be cited. Some ended disastrously;
others, because of the apathy, distrust, ignorance,
and superstition of the people, were lost sight
of again; while some, perhaps the most practical ones
and of which we find many indications in old writings,
were never made known for selfish reasons. Such has
been the fate of this&mdash;one of the most interesting problems&mdash;almost
up to the present time. We were, perhaps,
not prepared sufficiently, to receive the great
boon. We had to have the printing press, steam, and
electricity first, before we could attempt this next
great step towards a higher civilization.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.&mdash;DISCOVERY OF THE BALLOON.</h2>

<p>Although it is well understood now by most scientific
men, that the principles upon which ballooning rests,
will scarcely form any part in the solution of the problem
of ærial navigation; yet, when, in 1782, the
brothers, Mongolfier, in France, made the first successful
experiments with small paper balloons, filled with
heated air, it was thought that the key to that wonderful
art had been found; many applied themselves to its
improvement; and the next year already saw gas balloons
on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>The first passengers, who had the honor of being
sent up into the realms of space, were a sheep, a cock
and a duck; and as their safe descent proved highly
satisfactory, the well-known French savan, Pilatre de
Rozier, tried the same experiment shortly afterwards
with great success, reaching a hight of nearly two
miles. The glowing description of his experience
raised the excitement of all classes to fever heat. Numerous
day and night ascensions were made by diplomats,
distinguished naturalists, professors of note,
scientific women and gymnastic aspirants, and their
journeys soon became more daring and extended to
wider fields.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.&mdash;NOTED AIR VOYAGES.</h2>

<p>Blanchard, the supposed inventor of the parachute,
with the American, Dr. Jeffries, were the first to cross
the channel from England to France. M. Charles, the
inventor of the gas balloon, and one of the earliest and
most enthusiastic advocates of ærostation, made extensive
voyages. Madame Thible, of Lyons, was the first
of her sex who trusted herself to the elastic element.
Crosbie, who passed over the sea from Ireland to England,
came near losing his life; for, the balloon, being
struck with great force by an adverse current of air,
and most of the gas escaping, tore over the raging
waters at a fearful speed, until the courageous man was
rescued, near the English coast, by a ship happening in
his way. But the view which he had enjoyed, seeing
both countries at once, was sublime beyond description,
and compensated him for all the danger. He had been
at such a hight that, although the July sun melted
everything below, his ink was a lump of ice, and the
quicksilver in the instruments had sunk almost out of
sight.</p>

<p>The battle of Fleurus, in 1794, was won by the
French over the Austrians principally through the aid
of balloon reconnoitering; and similar service was occasionally
performed by the balloon in our own war. The
favorably known Italian, Count Zambeccari, who added
many improvements to this art, and created great interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
in the principal countries of Europe, made an
ascension, in 1803, with two friends, at Bologna. The
three alighted in the Adriatic sea and were picked up
by fishermen, while the balloon, free from weight, rose
again and was carried by the wind to the Turkish fort
Vihacz, where the commander, believing it a present
&quot;sent from heaven,&quot; had it cut up in small pieces and
divided amongst his friends as amulets. But quite a
&quot;reverse opinion&quot; was generally entertained by most
of the ignorant Christian country people, when the
huge monster happened to fall amongst them for the
first time; and their comparison of it to the &quot;evil one&quot;
is excusable when we consider the peculiar smell of
the escaping gas, after their attack upon it with pitchforks
and similar agricultural implements.</p>

<p>Among other remarkable ascensions is that of Guy
Lussac, who reached the prodigious hight of nearly four
and a half miles. This was exceeded, though, by
another scientific æronaut, James Glaisher, in 1862,
who, with a companion, mounted the great altitude of
seven miles&mdash;over 36,000 feet; but as he was insensible
for some minutes after reaching the elevation of 29,000
feet, the highest ever attained by human beings, their
calculations could only be approximated. The mercury
in the hygrometer&mdash;a delicate instrument for measuring
the moisture in the atmosphere&mdash;had fallen below the
scale, while they were rising more than 1000 feet per
minute. There are instances of balloons that have
shot upwards at the rate of fifty feet per second, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
much over half a mile per minute; but, generally, even
twenty feet per second is a rare occurrence. And here
might be mentioned that, since the late serious loss of
several French scientists by asphyxia, or cold on their
unfortunate ascension, the problem of maintaining life
in the highest regions of the atmosphere has been
solved in France. With a certain apparatus, man
could manage to live comfortably nearly ten miles
above the level of the sea, while, ordinarily, two miles
is the most.</p>

<p>As to horizontal speed, perhaps the fastest time on
record was made by Garnerin and Snowdon, from London
to Colchester, some eighty miles, in one hour, or
about 110 feet per second, almost swifter than an eagle
flies; and another balloon went from Paris across the
Alps, to the vicinity of Rome, in twenty-two hours,
making over fifty miles per hour, considering its zig-zag
travel. The reason for such great speed is, that the
different air currents travel far faster in the upper regions
than below, where the velocity of the wind is
seldom over twenty miles per hour; and yet, were it
not for the continually changing scenery, the æronaut
would imagine himself stationary.</p>

<p>The shortest trip, perhaps, in the annals of this art,
both as to hight and distance, was made, a few years
ago, by a gymnast, at Woodward's Gardens, that most
beautiful pleasure resort in this city. The little disobliging
monster went lazily, and with great difficulty,
over the fence and capsized promptly on the other side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
leaving the trapeze-man hanging, by the seat of his unmentionables,
on the top of it in an uncomfortable position,
but no bones were broken.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V.&mdash;ABSENCE OF DANGER.</h2>

<p>It is erroneous to suppose that ærial voyages are
fraught with even ordinary danger; on the contrary,
travel by sea and land is far more so; for, although
thousands of assensions have been made, but very few
persons have met with accidents, in fact, a less number
by far comparatively, than by any other profession or
mode of locomotion; and, whenever such has happened,
gross carelessness or ignorance was often the cause.</p>

<p>During the late Franco-German war, over sixty balloons,
many but indifferently constructed, left Paris,
during the siege, with some one hundred and eighty
persons and nearly three millions of letters. All
reached a point of safety.</p>

<p>Professor Wise, the most noted American æronaut,
has made, during the last forty years, nearly five hundred
voyages, and one in particular, in 1859, of nearly
1200 miles&mdash;perhaps the longest on record&mdash;with three
companions, from St. Louis, Mo., to New York State.
This trip was made partly in the midst of a tornado,
while above Lake Erie, during which time some twenty
sailing crafts succumbed to the effects of the storm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
yet the intrepid æronauts alighted in safety. M.
Green, who was the first to use coal gas, instead of
pure hydrogen, and has also made hundreds of successful
ascensions, was carried from London to Weilburg,
in the central part of Germany, about seven hundred
miles in eight hours, without the slightest mishap.
Lastly, Arban, crossed the Alps from Marseilles to Turin,
four hundred miles, in stormy weather during the
night. Mont Blanc to the left, on a level with the top of
which he was, resembled an immense block of crystal&mdash;sparkling
with a thousand fires; while the moon occasionally
seemed to have borrowed the light of the sun.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.&mdash;CHARM OF ÆRIAL TRAVEL.</h2>

<p>Nothing can equal the beauty of an ærial voyage,
that most wonderful, easy and luxurious mode of locomotion,
with its entire absence of dizziness&mdash;this sensation
being lost with the separation from earth, as
soon as the last cord, which unites us with the world
below, is cut.</p>

<p>In rising from the ground, the feelings are absorbed
in the novelty and magnificence of the spectacle presented,
while the ears are saluted with the buzz of distant
sound until the clouds are reached, when all is
still as death. The scene is sublime. Around and
beneath, the clouds roll in magnificent grandeur. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
form pyramids, castles, reefs, icebergs, ships and towers,
and again dissolve into chaos. The half obscured sun
shedding his mellow light upon the picture, gives it a
rich and dazzling lustre. Reverence for the work of
nature, the solemn stillness, an admiration indescribable,
all combined, seem to make a sound of praise.</p>

<p>The earth, which is never lost sight of at any hight,
except clouds interfere or night sets in, seems to be concave,
like the inside of a flattish hollow globe, instead
of the outside, as would naturally be supposed. The
reason for this optical delusion is, that the horizon appears
on a level with the æronaut, while the distance
downwards remains unaltered, making the surface below
appear like a valley. The earth presents the panoramic
view of an immense map, such as the enchanted
Alladdin must have enjoyed. The coloring, designating
the various products of the soil, is lively and
exquisite. Variegated grass-plats, the golden tinge of
waving grain fields, the more sombre foliage of the
trees, the glossy surface of the water dazzling in the
sunbeams, with occasional white specks for sailing craft;
the innumerable villages, with tastefully decorated and
tinny, toy-like houses, the numerous roads tortuously
spreading over the surface and looking like chalk lines
on a gaudy carpet, fairy-like carriages seemingly drawn
by mice and guided by liliputian little things. Such is
the beauty of this glorious earth. Yet, when mountains
appear like ant hills, and Niagara a neat little
cascade in a pleasure garden&mdash;instead of the raging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
grandeur, only a frothy bubble&mdash;man must be forcibly
reminded that he is but the minutest animalcule, and
not of so much importance as he presumes himself to
be.</p>

<p>No less impressive is the scene at night. The sublime
exhibition in the vast solitude and darkness of
night creates the most stupendous effect upon the lonely
æronaut.</p>

<p>The earth's surface, as far as the eye can reach, absolutely
teems with the scattered fires of a watchful population,
and exhibits a starry spectacle below, that rivals
in brilliancy the lustre of the firmament above. A city
looming up in the distant horizon gradually appears
to blaze like a vast conflagration. On drawing near,
every street is marked out by its particular line of fires;
the forms and positions of the theatres, squares and
markets are indicated by the presence of larger and
more irregular accumulations of light, and the faint
murmurs of a busy population still actively engaged in
the pursuits of pleasure or the avocation of gain; all
together combined form a picture, which, for beauty
and effect, can not be conceived.</p>

<p>Again, higher up, or when clouds intervene, the sky,
at all times darker when viewed from an elevation,
seems almost black with the intensity of night; while,
by contrast, the stars redoubled in their lustre, shine
like sparks of the whitest silver, scattered upon the
jetty dome around. Nothing can exceed this density
of night. Not a single object of terrestrial nature can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
anywhere be distinguished, and an unfathomable abyss
of &quot;darkness visible&quot; encompasses one on every side.
It seems like cleaving the way through an interminable
mass of black marble, and a light lowered from
these dizzy hights appears to absolutely melt its way
down into the frozen bosom of the surrounding inkiness.
The cold is here intense.</p>

<p>But while the charm of floating in the air is so fascinating
these delightful ascensions will be even more
beneficial in sanitary respects.</p>

<p>Atmospheric pressure, exerting nearly 30,000 pounds
upon a human being of full growth, has much to do
with the mechanical functions of life. At a moderate
elevation, one-tenth of this weight can be relieved, and
at greater hights, even one-third, as balloon experiments
have sufficiently proven. This pressure, then,
diminishing upon the muscular system, allows it to expand.
The lungs at once become more voluminous
and breathing purer air; the freedom with which all
the circulating fluids of the system are allowed to act
in the rare atmosphere, intensely quicken the animal
and mental faculties; the novelty of the voyage, and
the most sublime grandeur opening to the eye and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
mind of the invalid; all assist to promote health, impart
new life, inspire ideas and invigorate soul and
body.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.&mdash;PARACHUTES.</h2>

<p>This simple contrivance often forms an adjunct to
balloons. Its appearance is generally that of a huge
family umbrella of revolutionary times. It is likewise
concave underneath, because such form, above all
others, condenses a column of atmosphere more rapidly
and retards its velocity in the descent immensely.
The ribs are generally of whale-bone or bamboo covered
with strong domestic muslin, and a light wicker
basket is fastened some twelve feet underneath for the
æronaut, who may cut himself loose from the balloon
with perfect safety at any hight, and descend slowly to
the ground, if the parachute is strongly made and perhaps
fourteen feet across when open.</p>

<p>By giving it a slight inclination, it can be made to
descend, sliding-like, a long distance from the vertical
point; and some of the flying machines we read of
have likely been only a modified form of the parachute.
The nautilus on the ocean moves on the principle of it,
the pollen of plants is carried from one place to another
by this mode; so the flying squirrel moves in parabolic
curves from tree to tree and even crosses rivers when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
the nut crop fails; as also the flying tree-frog slants
down long distances from high trees. This animal has
a considerable expansion of skin, connecting the toes
only, and which looks as if on its four legs were fastened
those short, broad and light snow-shoes, known
as Webfeet, used in our northern Territories in winter.
It is, therefore, called a &quot;webfoot&quot; frog, but from
which must not be inferred that it is &quot;an Oregonian,&quot;
for it is encountered so far only in Borneo.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.&mdash;THE KITE.</h2>

<p>Every one is undoubtedly acquainted with the exceedingly
simple mechanism&mdash;invented when boys
commenced to exist&mdash;for the enjoyment of one of the
most pleasant pastimes&mdash;kite flying. It is indulged in
mostly during the fall, and, perhaps, a trifle more so in
the rural districts than in the cities, because of the
greater freedom of room which stubble fields and
meadows allow.</p>

<p>But attention has also been given to the employment
of this kind of ærostation as a means of support and
conveyance; and kites have been made as much as
thirty feet high, looking more like buoyant sails than
boyish playthings, and exerting an immense power of
waftage. Loaded wagons have been drawn over
turnpikes; persons have frequently been carried up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
the air by huge kites; and, in some parts of Europe,
experiments have been made to signal and save shipwrecked
people on dangerous coasts, proving sufficiently
that the kite can be made, even in its present
primitive state, to be quite useful.</p>

<p>In this connection it may &quot;not be amiss&quot; to state
that the first person known to have ascended&mdash;some
eighty years ago, as the &quot;History of Kite Carriage&quot;
informs us, &quot;was a Miss&quot;&mdash;a young lady of some one
hundred and twenty-six pounds, avoirdupois. She
was seated in a chair underneath the gigantic structure
which weighed nearly thirty pounds, had a surface of
about sixty square feet, and rose most majestically to
a hight of six hundred feet&mdash;an incontrovertible instance
of the superior courage of the gentler sex over
man.</p>

<p>The kite is maintained in the air by two opposing
forces: the impelling power of the wind&mdash;lifting it by
striking against it at an angle, and the restraining
powers of the string&mdash;motive-force and gravitation
combined; so that in the kite, above all, we possess in
a crude form, the three principles requisite for artificial
flight: the plain, weight and propelling force. By
improving upon the kite, therefore, we will arrive at
the practical solution of the problem of artificial flight.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X.&mdash;BALLOONS IMPRACTICABLE.</h2>

<p>It is not creditable to the present age that the problem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
of ærial navigation has not been solved. But
one of the causes has undoubtedly been the discovery
of the balloon, which has retarded this science for
nearly a century by misleading men's minds, and causing
them to look for a solution of the problem by the
aid of a machine lighter than air, and which has no
analogue in nature.</p>

<p>Weight is one of three essential factors in flight, for
a light body cannot be propelled through a heavier one.
Hence all attempts at driving and guiding the balloons
have signally failed. This arises from the vast extent
of surface which it necessarily presents, rendering it a
fair conquest to every breeze that blows, and because
the power which animates it is a mere lifting power,
which acts in a vertical line. The balloon, consequently,
rises through the air in opposition to the law
of gravity, by which all flying creatures are governed,
very much as a dead bird falls downward in accordance
with it. Having no hold upon the air, this cannot be
employed as a fulcrum for regulating its movements,
and hence the cardinal difficulty of ballooning as an art
of locomotion and its uncertainty, because the air-currents
cannot be regulated. A balloon starting from
San Francisco might be intended for New York, but,
against the desire of the passengers, alight in China or
the Canibal Islands, which would be rather disagreeable.</p>

<p>It is simply astonishing to hear of people trying, year
after year, to propel elongated or cigar-shaped balloons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
with a car underneath, and a screw-propeller, of course&mdash;an
experiment which was tried, unsuccessfully,
forty years ago. But this is generally the first conceived
project of an aspirant for fame who commences
to think on the subject, and soon fancies himself the
happy possessor of the secret; yet what a very small
amount of science is necessary to show its fallacy. In
fact, all kinds of propositions for the propulsion of balloons
have been advanced and experimented upon, but
scarcely any improvements have been made since the
first five years after its invention; proving, perhaps,
more conclusively than anything else, that the practical
propulsion of balloons is an impossibility.</p>

<p>The most remarkable idea in this respect, was undoubtedly
that of Teissol. He flattered himself to be
able to train geese or other birds to pull a balloon by
being hitched to it, while the conductor, in a car underneath,
was to direct their movements by the aid of
a long pole. Although the training of birds is not so
ridiculous as it may seem, yet he found that geese, if
not too tough, answer the purpose of a good roast
much better. And another genius, still more unique,
long before balloons were invented, conceived the idea
that air, like water, must have a defined limit, and that
it was possible to sail on its surface like ships on the
ocean. He did not state how to get up there, but lost
no time in inducing the King of Portugal to forbid
everyone, under penalty of death, to use said invention.
So far, no one has come in conflict with that
law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
Yet, although the balloon is impracticable as a
means of transportation, it should by no means be discarded,
for it can be made very useful for scientific and
other observations, to give pleasure to thousands of
people by fanciful ascensions, and not the least, to serve,
as stated before, sanitary purposes, when captive and
well secured. But instead of lowering and elevating
it continually, as is being done at present, and which occasions
danger and great loss of time and money, a contrivance
should be made by which persons could safely,
and without interruption, be carried up and down underneath
parachutes.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI.&mdash;REASONS WHY THE PROBLEM
HAS REMAINED UNSOLVED.</h2>

<p>The slow progress made, and the unsatisfactory state
of the question, notwithstanding the large and universal
share of attention bestowed upon the subject
from earliest times, must be attributed to a variety of
causes, the most prominent of which are&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The great difficulty of the problem.</p>

<p>&quot;The incapacity on the one hand, or theoretical tendencies
on the other, of those who have devoted themselves
to its elucidation.</p>

<p>&quot;The lack of means of inventors generally, and the
difficulty of obtaining the same to experiment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
carry out their ideas even after the completion of their
invention. Hence so many failures amongst this class,
while men of genius in the literary or most other fields
require but little pecuniary outlay to succeed.</p>

<p>&quot;The stolid indifference of an unthinking community,
which so often proves the deathblow to the mind
of the philosophical inquirer, and whose aim is condemned
and pronounced as 'visionary,' absurd and
incapable of realization, instead of receiving that support
and encouragement which is so necessary to success.&quot;</p>

<p>Flight has therefore been unusually unfortunate in
its votaries. It has been cultivated on the one hand
by profound thinkers, especially mathematicians, who
have worked out innumerable theorems, but have
never submitted them to test of experiment; and on
the other by either uneducated charlatans who, despising
the abstractions of science entirely, have made the
most wild and ridiculous attempts at a practical solution
of the problem; or inventors, who, desirous to
triumph over some of the acknowledged difficulties of
propulsion and navigation, but for want of organization
or pecuniary support, or being unacquainted with
preceding failures in the same direction, or ignorant of
some one condition demanded by the peculiar nature
of the experiment, but which is absolutely necessary to
success, have also failed, thus causing still greater
doubt in the public mind, and, consequently, less support
to inventors in the same direction afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
A common error prevails, that models are essential
to help the inventor. The province of the model is to
explain the invention to others after it has been made,
and not to assist the inventor. Except in very restricted
limits they have been found to be almost
useless, and most of our valuable discoveries have been
made and carried out without their aid. Watt's first
condensing engine had a cylinder of eighteen inches
diameter, or about the average size now in use. It is
so with agricultural and other practical inventions and
applies particularly to flying machines. Models often
signally prove failures on a small scale, yet would be
successful on a larger.</p>

<p>The problem is not an unphilosophical phantom, but
a mathematically demonstrated truth, which needs
only actual realization to revolutionize the world for
the better. That the air is navigable can no longer be
denied.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.&mdash;FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF
FLIGHT.</h2>

<p>In contemplating the boundless atmosphere, we perceive
it to be tenanted by a multitude of creatures of
varied form and size, who move and direct themselves
with marvellous ease and skill. These beings, so different
in their nature, form and construction&mdash;from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
the proud eagle to the &quot;blood-thirsty&quot; mosquito&mdash;resemble
one another in the possession of three important
fundamental principles which constitute the
power of flight. These are&mdash;weight or gravity, surface
or resistance of the atmosphere against it, and
force or power of projection.</p>

<p>The medium in which the phenomenon of flight is
produced&mdash;the air&mdash;is an invisible, impalpable, comparatively
imponderable fluid, and its density is nearly
800 times less than that of water. Hence a movement
through it can be made far more rapidly than through
its sister medium. Nevertheless, if agitated, it is capable
of exerting great pressure, as the tempestuous
storms, overturning fences, unroofing houses, uprooting
trees, and carrying even large animals into the air,
teach us. Hereon then, that is, the proper manipulation
principally in creating artificial currents of air,
hinges the secret of flight, because this phenomenon is
reproduced in a manner identical, if a surface is moved
against it, as we see in the wings of flying creatures.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII.&mdash;WEIGHT.</h2>

<p>Weight is absolutely indispensible in flight, it adds
momentum and assists the propelling power&mdash;with
greater force comparatively in heavier bodies. A
wooden cannon ball can fly only a fraction of the distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
of an iron one; and an equal weight of musket
balls, propelled by the same charge of powder, will not
reach near so far as the cannon ball, because of its consolidation
in one body; and a feather or little toy balloon
can not only not be propelled, but will actually
recoil if attempted. Hence, all flying animals are
many hundred times heavier than air, and the heaviest
are generally the best flyers, yet require the least
amount of surface and force in proportion.</p>

<p>The sympathy existing between weight and power is
very great. Weight acts in flight upon the oblique
surfaces of the wings in conjunction with the power
expended, and thereby husbanding the latter immensely.
Thus only are the denizens of the air enabled
to perform long journeys, while otherwise they
could retain their position in the upper region but a
very brief time, as their strength is no greater than
that of other animals and would soon give out. Weight
acts on flying creatures in a similar manner as we see
it in the clock, where weight is the moving power, and
the pendulum merely regulates its movements.</p>

<p>Of course, the belief of many, that birds have large
air cells in their interior, that those cavities contain
heated air, and that this heated air in some mysterious
manner contributes to, if it does not actually produce,
flight, falls to the ground upon the least reflection. No
argument could be more fallacious. The bird is a
heavy, compact, by no means bulky body, and that
trifle of heated air, or gas, if such were the case, but is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
not, which possibly might help elevation, would be
but dust in the scale. A small balloon of two feet diameter&mdash;a
larger body than any bird&mdash;can lift only
about a quarter of a pound. But, besides, many admirable
flyers, such as bats, have no air cells; while
many animals, never intended to fly, are provided with
them. It may, therefore, be reasonably concluded that
flight is in no way connected with air cells, and the
best proof that can be adduced is to be found in the
fact that it can be performed to perfection in their
absence.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV.&mdash;SURFACE.</h2>

<p>The next of the three properties necessary for flight,
is the extension of the locomotive organs in winged beings&mdash;the
planes. Although the wings in the different
animals differ much in their form, texture, construction,
number, and the matter which composes them,
yet they resemble one another in the expansion and
development of their surfaces, being stretched on each
side of the body, and playing the part of a parachute.
The animal, therefore, cannot fall like a stone, in obedience
to the accelerated force of gravity, but it descends
with a slow velocity; constant regular, and considerably
abated.</p>

<p>This influence, then, exercised by the flat surface on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
the fall of masses, is seen in a sheet of paper of the
same weight as a grain of lead, it will fall much more
slowly. But if we make the paper a compact ball, and
flatten the lead into a broad, thin sheet, the reverse
result will be produced, and the paper reach the
ground before the lead. Therefore, bodies in the air
are light or heavy in proportion to their surfaces, and
the heaviest may become light by an alteration of
form. For successful flight, then, a just proportion of
surface and weight is necessary; because, as stated,
the air being elastic, its resistance is much more effectual
with light bodies than heavy ones; and this
proportion is such that the extent of surface is always
in an inverse ratio to the weight of the winged
animal.</p>

<p>The principle in the fall of flat surfaces is strictly applicable
to the bird. Its weight, tending downwards,
and being situated below the plain of suspension, keeps
it well balanced, so that it cannot fall head over heels,
nor rapidly. If the wings are inclined at an angle with
the horizon, the bird will not descend vertically, but
glide along an inclined plane with much greater swiftness,
because the vertical distance remains unaltered in
the same space of time. Hence their immense horizontal
velocity, without comparatively any effort.
This is in obedience to two forces&mdash;gravity, or weight,
and resistance of surface.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV.&mdash;POWER.</h2>

<p>But for actual flight a third force is required&mdash;the
propelling power, the necessary amount of which has
greatly been overrated by many mathematicians.</p>

<p>Borelli estimated the power of a three pound bird
to be over one hundred and thirty horses relatively.
But, Navier, more reasonably, calculated a force of
five horses sufficient for the flight of a pigeon. Coulomb,
again, offset this &quot;great liberality&quot; by demonstrating
that the surface to support a man must be two
miles long and two hundred feet wide, with the power
of a &quot;Corliss engine&quot; to propel such a &quot;fifty acre
ranch.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, facts prove that man can, without danger,
descend from an high elevation under a surface of much
less than fifteen feet diameter; and the force to lift
himself, as will be shown hereafter, is also comparatively
small. He can walk up stairs, and likewise
mount upon air, which, properly manipulated, becomes
sufficiently solid.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated beyond a doubt, that the
heaviest flying animals require the smallest amount of
surface and power in proportion. The surface is less,
because the resistance of the atmosphere is much
greater toward one unbroken body than all the parts
thereof if detached. Hence a stork, weighing eight
times as much as a pigeon, needs only five square feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
of surface, while the eight pigeons, with nearly one
square foot each, possess together over seven square
feet; and the common fly, if magnified to the size of
the crane, would show a surface sixty times as large.</p>

<p>The heaviest flyers require the least amount of
power, because weight, as stated before, itself is power,
which increases in a certain ratio. Hence we find the
muscular force of the smaller beings, who possess little
weight, to be enormous; this is particularly so with
insects, who are the strongest in creation. A stag-beetle,
of which two hundred weigh only one pound,
can lift fourteen ounces; crickets leap eighty times their
own length, and the &quot;lively flea&quot; can jump through
space estimated at even two hundred times the length
of its body&mdash;which accounts for the difficulty of catching
it. If a mouse would simply reproduce the gait
of a horse, its progress would be about twenty inches
per minute only, and cats would soon find themselves
out of employment.</p>

<p>Nature has wisely established a compensation to
make amends for the diminutiveness of organs by
rapidity of movement, and has, consequently, furnished
the animal with the necessary power to produce this
rapidity.</p>

<p>The force necessary for lifting in all winged beings
is not near so great as is generally supposed. The fall
of a body, continually accelerating, is seventeen feet
per second, and a very great force would be necessary
indeed to offset this gravitation, if that second were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
allowed to expire without a counter-movement; but
when that body is provided with a parachute-like arrangement,
there is no such rapid fall of seventeen feet
per second; and when, besides, the force is applied
constantly, thereby counteracting even a fraction of the
fall, the power needed to accomplish this is but a trifle;
it is the principle, to use a homely phrase, that &quot;a
stitch in time saves nine.&quot; What extra strength the
animal possesses has to be used in pursuit or escape,
from the powerful eagle to the minutest insect; they
must be prepared to exert at a given moment all the
strength that nature has given to them in store.</p>

<p>Their strength is no greater than that of fishes or
quadrupeds; all possess surplus power greatly above
the need of their average use, and the strength exhibited
therefore by flying creatures shows only that
but a small portion of it is used for lifting and propelling
purposes.</p>

<p>Eagles have been known to carry off small deer,
lambs, hares, and even young children. Many of the
fishing birds, as pelicans and herons, can likewise carry
considerable loads, while the smaller birds are capable
of transporting comparatively large twigs for building
purposes. A swallow can traverse 1000 miles at a
single journey, and the swift, the fastest of all, is
known to have made nearly 180 miles an hour. The
albatross, despising compass and land-mark, trusts
himself boldly for weeks together to the mercy or fury
of the mighty ocean; and the huge condor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
Andes, as Humboldt, Darwin, Orton, and others inform
us, lifts himself to a hight where no sound is
heard, and from an unseen point surveys, in solitary
grandeur, the wide range of plain and mountain below.
He has been seen flying over the Chimborazo, and attains,
on occasions, an altitude of six miles.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI.&mdash;FLYING CREATURES, THEIR PROPORTIONS,
MOVEMENTS.</h2>

<p>The great common characteristic of the different
winged beings are the same throughout all the modifications
of detail. These are, as stated, weight, extension
of surface, and the mechanical application of the propelling
force; so that the animal is a gliding plane,
part of which is fixed and the other moveable, and the
whole being maintained in stable equilibrium by the
weight of the body, placed a little below the plane of
suspension.</p>

<p>By comparing the different species it is found, by
M. de Lucy and others, that the extent of surface is in
inverse ratio to the weight, the determination of this
ratio being based upon certain considerations. The
proof of this is overwhelming. Supposing all flying
creatures of the same weight, say one pound, it is
found that the:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
Thus we find the gnat, of which 160,000 make one
pound, and which weighs four hundred and sixty times
less than the beetle, has thirteen times more surface,
comparatively. The sparrow weighs about ten times
less than the pigeon, and has twice as much surface in
proportion. The Australian crane&mdash;one of the heaviest
birds, it weighs over twenty pounds, or almost three
million times as much as the gnat&mdash;possesses the least
surface&mdash;not quite ten square feet, or one hundred and
twenty times less than that insignificant but formidable
animal. Yet its flight is, gliding softly on the air,
without effort or fatigue, with but little exertion, the
longest maintained, and it can, with few exceptions,
elevate itself the highest.</p>

<p>In regard to the movements of the wings, there is a
similar ratio; for, while the mosquito makes over two
hundred wing strokes per second, the sparrow makes
only thirteen, the buzzard three, and so on, continually
decreasing with heavier bodies.</p>

<p>A word about bats and flying fish. Although bats
present no real resemblance whatever to birds or insects,
but are much more like ourselves, they must be
classed amongst the creatures of the air, because they
are constantly moving in it, and governed by the
same laws.</p>

<p>Their flight, being somewhat fluttering, but otherwise
powerful, true and perfect, is undoubtedly caused,
particularly in the early part of the night, when feeding,
by their darting right and left after the almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
invisible numerous insects, which they devour at once.</p>

<p>The wing of the bat is, like that of the bird, concavo-convex,
and also more or less twisted upon itself, but
it differs in so far that its arm is not covered with
feathers, but a very delicate membrane, which forms
the parachute-like wing.</p>

<p>Their nocturnal, and therefore disreputable habits,
with our dislike for the blood-sucking propensity of a
large specie, the vampire, has kept our interest in
these otherwise harmless and clean creatures at rather
freezing point. But they can be tamed easily, and are
capable of giving considerable pleasure.</p>

<p>The flight of a shoal of flying-fish as they shoot forth
from the dark green wave in a glittering throng, gleaming
brightly in the sunshine, is a charming sight. But
these fish can scarcely be classed with the creatures of
the air, because true flight, that is the manipulation of
the wings, is lacking. They are mentioned because
they represent, like the kite, the first step toward that
true flight which all other creatures in the air possess.</p>

<p>They are capable of moving through the air from
500 to 600 feet, and as much as 20 feet above the
water. The fish first acquires initial velocity by a preliminary
rush through the water, when it throws itself
suddenly into the air, and, at the same moment, spreads
out, kite-like, at a slight inclination upwards, its extraordinarily
large pectoral fins. It keeps up the great
speed until its momentum is exhausted, when the same
performance is repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
The fact in favor of mechanical flight is certainly
incontrovertible that less surface and less power is required
and flight maintained the longest, in proportion
to heavier bodies.</p>

<p>It must be convincing, therefore, that it is possible
for man to apply the laws of flight to industrial purposes
in the same manner as he has been able, in these
days, to apply all the other grand physical laws that
he has taken the trouble to study and fathom. The
law of surface and force reigns in the most absolute
and exact manner over all flying animals. It does not
stop here. Nature, whose laws are general and universal,
has not created this one only for the restricted
compass of the winged animate beings. The law which
sustains on the water the leaf and the straw is the same
for the gigantic Great Eastern; and the mechanical law
of the forces which drives the wheelbarrow also conducts
on its iron line the locomotive and its endless
train.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII.&mdash;MECHANICAL PRACTICABILITY
OF ARTIFICIAL FLIGHT.</h2>

<p>Living beings have been, in every age, compared to
machines, but it is only in the present day that the
bearing and justice of this comparison are fully comprehensible.
Modern engineers have created machines
which execute more difficult and various operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
than animate beings are capable of; yet it is always
from nature first that man has to draw his inspirations.</p>

<p>Of the different functions of animal mechanism, that
of locomotion is certainly one of the most important
and interesting; and as we have brought this art on
land and water, by successfully imitating the natural
movements of walking and swimming, to quite a high
state of perfection, the next great problem, equally
possible, because flight is a natural movement, remains
to be solved.</p>

<p>Of course, as different as the wheel of the locomotive
is from the limb of the quadruped, and the screw of
a steamship from the fin of a fish, so will the coming
flying machine differ from the construction of bird, bat
or insect.</p>

<p>Walking, swimming and flying are modifications of,
and merging into, each other by insensible gradations;
and the modifications, resulting therefrom, are necessitated
by the amount of support afforded on, and in the
different mediums&mdash;earth, water, air. Although
flight is, indisputably, the finest of the different
animal movements, yet it does not essentially differ
from the other two, as the material and forces employed
are literally the same as those in walking and
swimming.</p>

<p>Flight is, therefore, a purely mechanical problem,
and in compliance with the law of decrease, as stated
before, the surface requisite to transport bodies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
air, is found to be about one-half, proportionately, to
twelve times the weight.</p>

<p>Applying this observation to an apparatus of, say
200 &#8468;s., we find that the surface of a bird of 18 &#8468;s.&mdash;about
one-twelfth of said 200 &#8468;s.&mdash;to be 10 square
feet; multiplying this by twelve, its weight, we have
120 square feet of surface, and of which one-half accordingly,
60 square feet, is enough for the support of
200 pounds. Such a machine, although possessing
much less surface than parachutes generally do, is in
the form of inclined planes of proper construction, fully
sufficient for man to slide down safely through the air,
without exertion, from an elevation at least ten times
the vertical distance, that is, from the top of the Palace
Hotel to the foot of Baldwin's.</p>

<p>As to the force required, although impossible to
give datas, the law of decrease with greater weight
reigns absolute here also. Man's muscular power for
tolerably swift horizontal flight is far greater than
necessary; and, with properly constructed contrivances,
he will be able to travel, at an incline upwards of one
in thirty, at least twenty miles an hour, by manual
power alone. A carrier pigeon flies, for a short time,
at the rate of one hundred miles an hour, and some
birds much faster. But in employing any of the many
excellent motive powers at command now, and with
larger machines, we will be able to surpass the swiftest
birds.</p>

<p>As for the objection, that the fury of the wind will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
hinder artificial flight, it is refuted by observing that
even a hurricane, which, traveling over eighty
miles an hour, occurs but rarely, does hardly prevent
the flight of fast birds, and still less would
that of a compact and solid flying machine, because of
its greater weight and momentum. And even if an
occasional storm should be dangerous, the machine,
by its greater swiftness, could be turned above, below
or sideways, out of the path of destruction, or it need
not travel at such rare times. Besides, the effect of the
storm upon a body within its own medium is insignificant
to what it is when that body offers resistance by
being attached to another medium, as ships on the
water, or houses and fences on land.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII.&mdash;FLYING MACHINES OF THE
PRESENT, THEIR DEFECTS.</h2>

<p>When it was found that no marked improvements
could be made in balloons, the more advanced thinkers,
turning their attention in an opposite direction, commenced
to justly regard the winged being as the true
model for flying machines; and experiments are now
being made, in different parts of the world, of which
all go to prove that &quot;<i>flight is far more a question of
mechanical adaptation, construction and manipulation,
than of enormous power</i>,&quot; which, of course, in any experiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
must prove unavailable, if improperly applied.
Some of the motive engines, lately exhibited in England,
produced such remarkable power as certainly no bird
possesses. One of four-horse power weighed 40
pounds, and occupied but a few cubic feet; another of
13 pounds exerted over one-horse power; and, at some
experiments in France last year, a steam engine of
two and a half horse power weighed 80 &#8468;s.; and, being
applied to a machine with two vertical screw propellers
of 12 ft. diameter each, it raised 120 &#8468;s. of the whole
weight of 160 &#8468;s.</p>

<p>But, as far as known, these different motive powers
have been employed so far only to elevate and propel
machines by vertical fan-like contrivances&mdash;helicopterics
or by æroplanes, pushed forward and upward by
screw propellers; either quite as irrational as ballooning,
because the rigid plane, wedged forward and upward
at a given angle, in a straight line, or in a circle,
does not embody the principles carried out in nature.
Hence, the several advocates of the æroplane and
helicopteric have met with but indifferent success.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best representative model of a flying
machine on the principles of inclined planes, was that
of Mr. Stringfellow, exhibited in London, in 1868, and
which occasionally could rise. It had three æroplanes,
superimposed as advocated by Wenham, the frames of
which were made of light wood, with cloth drawn
over it tightly, like rigid kites, fixed parallel one above
the other, with a tail attached to the middle one. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
had a small box underneath for the motive power, and
a light screw propeller behind for pushing it forward.
By giving the machine an upward angle, the planes
strike continually upon new layers of air, and so
cause a rise, like a kite pushed from behind. The whole
structure had about thirty-six square feet of surface,
and weighed, including the steam engine, which exerted
nearly one-half horse power, under 12 pounds. It
proved conclusively that, while the inclined plane, in a
practical and different form, is necessary for ærostation,
the secret of solving the problem lays far more
in the mechanical application of certain laws governing
the art of flight, than in enormous power.</p>

<p>These kite-form machines did not succeed, in spite
of their great motive power and lightness, because the
supporting planes were not active and flexible, but presented
passive or dead surfaces, without power to accommodate
themselves to altered circumstances. These
planes were made to strike the air at a given angle, instead
of continually changing to suit the elastic medium,
and in which respect the ordinary kite is a better
flying machine. If not driven with great velocity,
such a machine can not support itself in the atmosphere;
besides, on account of its great surface exposed,
a strong wind can easily capsize it; while natural
wings, on the contrary, present small flying surfaces,
and their great speed converts the space through which
they are driven, into a solid basis for support. This
arrangement enables wings to seize and utilize the air,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
and renders them superior to the adverse currents, not
of their forming. In this respect they entirely differ
from balloons, and all forms of fixed æroplanes.</p>

<p>The different small helicopteric models, relying entirely
on the aid of the screw, made from time to time,
were also lacking, as stated before, in some of the true
principles of flight; although some of these models
could not only rise, but also carry a certain amount of
freight, as was shown by the delicately constructed
clockwork models of M. Nadar, a prominent French
scientist, and others. One remarkable model, exhibited
some years ago, was that of M. Phillips. It was
made entirely of metal, weighed two pounds, had four
two-bladed fans inclined to the horizon at an angle of
twenty degrees, and made to revolve in opposite directions
with immense energy. The motive power employed
was obtained from the combustion of charcoal,
nitre and gypsum, the products of combustion mixing
with water in the boiler and forming gas-charged
steam, which was delivered at a high pressure from the
extremities of the arms of the fans, on the principle
discovered by Hero, of Alexandria.</p>

<p>The production of flight by artificial wings is the
most ancient method proposed, and will, undoubtedly,
in a greatly modified form, and in combination with
other contrivances, solve the problem; but to exactly
imitate natural wings will be found as impossible as
the production by the other different methods proposed
so far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
Of the more recent attempts at the solution of the
problem by means of artificial wings, worked by steam
power, the perhaps most determined was that of Mr.
Kauffman, of Glasgow. The machine had superimposed
æroplanes, similar to those used by Stringfellow.
The two wings were of great length, narrow, pointed
towards the end, and were made to flap up and down
somewhat like the wings of a bird. The model exhibited
weighed, complete, 42 &#8468;s., but the dimensions
for a large machine were to be: length, about 30 ft.;
hight, 5 ft.; width, 6 ft.; length of each wing, 60 ft.;
surface of each, 400 ft.; total weight of machine, 8000
&#8468;s.; nominal power, 120 horses; intended speed, 60
miles per hour; with water supply for five hours and
oil as fuel for ten hours. Besides, a pendule, weighing
85 &#8468;s., and 40 ft. in length, was attached, which could,
telescope-like, be drawn up when necessary. The
model was made exactly, to show the inventor's
theory, and to ascertain if the connection to the wings
could be made strong enough to withstand the violent
twisting and bending strains to which they were exposed.
When steam at a pressure of over 150 &#8468;s. was
turned on, the wings made a short series of furious
flaps and broke. The experiment failed, because, to
exactly imitate the movements of the long and delicate
wings of fast-flying birds on a large scale, is impossible;
the leverage to flap up and down 60 ft. long wings being
simply enormous beyond computation, and no
material can be found strong enough to withstand it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
Another machine, the propulsion of which was also
to be effected by means of artificial wings, was exhibited
some years ago in England. It differed entirely
from the other in this respect, that it was very light,
weighing scarcely 30 &#8468;s., and was intended for a man
to fly by his own muscular power. It had about 70
square feet of surface, two short wings, and the ribs
were made of paragon wire, such as is used in umbrellas,
and covered with silk. By a preliminary quick
run, the inventor could take short, jump-like flights of
more than 100 feet; but this machine was also in a
very crude state of perfection.</p>

<p>These different practical experiments, although more
or less unsuccessful, and others similar, but of which
many models were far more ingenious than practical,
have at least established the certain prospect and certainty
of an early solution of the problem. And were
it not that but very few, comparatively, of the great
number of theories, which have been proposed from
time to time for the accomplishment of this great object,
have been submitted to anything resembling even
the remotest approach to practical tests, and that the
lack of means is generally the insurmountable barrier
in experimenting, ærial navigation would to-day be an
established fact.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX.&mdash;THE PRACTICAL FLYING SHIP OF
THE NEAR FUTURE.</h2>

<p>Possessing then, all the datas possible on the subject,
it is, perhaps, not so very difficult as is generally supposed,
to arrive at a satisfactory result; and, like other
great inventions before, the coming air ship will also
be a rather simple affair. While it will not likely possess
such prodigious weight as 8000 to 10,000 pounds,
with a hundred and twenty horse-power steam engine&mdash;sufficient
almost for a man of war, it will neither be
as light as a feather, comparatively, but hold the golden
middle.</p>

<p>The inclined planes, in a greatly modified form, will
by no means be discarded, as in fact no flying machine
could be built otherwise. But, as stated before, this
is only one principle long recognized, the A B C, so
to speak, towards the solution of the problem. These
planes, in wedging forward, for certain reasons, should
be <i>elastic</i>, in some manner, and which has not been attempted
by any inventor yet. The frames and covering
of all models, built so far, have been rigid and immoveable,
and yet, even with these great defects, partial
success has been obtained already.</p>

<p>The fan or screw never will be used as the <i>only</i>
means in propelling, but will be very effective in doing
service as a part of the whole, with other contrivances
in driving and guiding. But their form and
style must be considerably different from anything
known at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
A modified and peculiar form and style of wings, as
mentioned here before, must also be employed in combination
with the planes and fans, to serve the double
purpose of driving and lifting. By the manipulation
of these wings the accumulating and compressed air is
thrown underneath the machine, thereby urging the
same in a forward and upward direction, and by which
the planes in front are made to continually rise upon
new layers of the elastic medium, like a kite when the
boy runs forward.</p>

<p>The planes must be fixed in such a manner that they
can be set at different angles with the horizon, in order
that the machine may rise sooner when the angle is
greatest, because of the greater resistance of the air
against a larger surface exposed; and to glide through
the atmosphere swifter, after elevation has been attained,
when the angle of the planes is most acute,
thereby offering the least amount of surface to the
horizontally opposing air. No flying creature rises in
the air vertically, but ascends at an incline.</p>

<p>A swallow, one of the very best flyers, lifts itself
with difficulty from the ground. An eagle, particularly
after eating, has to run some distance flapping its
wings vigorously before it can rise. An insect, possessing
considerable spring-power in its limbs, always
takes a good jump at the moment its wings are spread
out for elevation, at an upward angle forward. With
similar contrivances for the purpose must a practical
flying machine be provided. It should, in combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
with a certain amount of spring power, to enable it to
rise with greater ease at the final moment, and also to
reduce the shock in alighting to a minimum, have
wheels to run over the ground, until sufficient force and
momentum has been attained to launch it into the
boundless realms of space.</p>

<p>To be thoroughly practical, the machine must be under
perfect control, and be made to descend upon any
spot desired with absolute safety and ease. This can
be accomplished by the combined effort of the propellors
and wings. By exerting the power of these contrivances
in opposite directions the disturbed atmosphere
is thrown in volumes underneath the machine,
which, on account of its similarity to a parachute,
although of a greatly different form, can be made to
descend vertically and very slow.</p>

<p>The doubt expressed by many, that the guidance of
an air ship is possible, is easily refuted. All bodies,
possessing the propelling force within them, can guide
themselves in an elastic medium. Of this we have
millions of examples before us in all flying creatures.</p>

<p>Finally, a practical shape and proper size and
weight will form one of the most essential elements in
a successful flying machine, and which has been disregarded
more or less so far. Of course, it is impossible
to calculate already, before an actual machine has been
built and datas can be fixed, the limits of these factors
in the average ærial structure. My impressions are,
that the weight of a single carriage will be from 400
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
to 500 lbs., inclusive; a motive force of 3 to 5 horse
power. It will have a total length of from forty to fifty
feet, by about the same in width, from tip to tip; and
a surface of from 500 to 600 square feet will be more
than sufficient to sustain a total weight of 1000 lbs.;
for such a machine will be capable to carry from
three to four persons, or its equivalent weight of express
matter, letters, newspapers, and other light
freight. Of course, free mail facilities for our wise solons
will, perhaps, unfortunately have to be barred out.</p>

<p>When the novelty and excitement of this style of
travel will have subsided, we may take the next step
in ærostation by carrying a much greater number of
passengers and heavier freight; not in a single machine,
but by making two or more to support inclined planes
of certain construction between them. These planes,
in swift horizontal flight, could be made to carry, in
suitable cars underneath, much more than their own
weight, because the power of support which the air
affords to inclined planes at a great speed is simply
enormous, amounting to 50 &#8468;s. per square ft. in a
pressure of 100 miles per hour. For this purpose, the
manner of placing these æroplanes one above the other,
as proposed by Mr. Wenham many years ago, would be
practical to some extent.</p>

<p>The great swiftness with which these machines are
expected to travel, seems at first to rouse fear in us to
trust our more or less valuable lives into such a wonderful
structure; and it possibly staggers our belief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
that such great speed can be performed with any degree
of safety to brittle bone and breathing valve.
But all these objections are easily refuted. The ærial
traveler sits securely inside the strong machine, in no
danger of catching a cold from the strong air-current
rushing by, very much like the passenger in a railroad
car; and if of an inquisitive turn of mind for the
beauty of the surrounding panorama, he has suitable
windows for observation. If the air passenger suffers
from gout, rheumatism, or is susceptible to sea-sickness,
he will experience no inconvenience, because there is
no jogging, no rumbling over cobble-stones or broken
rails, or riding on a heavy sea; he will feel no motion
at whatever hight he may be, but will glide voluptuously&mdash;without
perception almost&mdash;like a summer
cloud through the vast ocean of the ærial fluid.</p>

<p>The machine being under perfect control, can be
made to travel very slow when towards the point of
destination, and may be stopped at any hight to remain
stationary or leisurely descend. And lastly, speed appears
greatly diminished when the object is viewed
from a distance, as we can observe on a railroad train.
A telegraph pole standing near the track will flit by
like a flash of lightning, so to speak; but if any considerable
distance off, it disappears very slow. But
when an object is followed by the eye from a considerable
elevation, this fact is still more striking. The eye
can command at a glance almost hundreds of miles of
country, and a city can be seen at a distance of at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
fifty miles in advance, giving the æronaut ample time
for preparing a descent, if so desired. Of course, he
must be well acquainted with landmarks, to know
what part of country he is in; but this knowledge will
be acquired much easier than water navigation.</p>

<p>Such about will be the coming flying-machine of the
near future. The natural elements, so far from presenting
barriers and obstacles, as they do to a great
extent on land and ocean navigation, seem to be peculiarly
inviting to ærostation.</p>

<p>Previous to nearly every great discovery, difficulties
have been thought to exist which its completion dissolved.
In the days of stage-coaching, the expectations
held out by those interested in steam transport
were considered, even by most competent and intelligent
men, as wholly chimerical; yet the locomotive far
surpasses the race-horse in speed and endurance. When
practice proved and datas could be fixed, that smooth
tires met all the requirements on railroads&mdash;in place
of cogwheels to gear into racks&mdash;how easy all calculations
on adhesive force and friction then became. So
with flight.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX.&mdash;WHAT THE CHANGES FOR THE
BETTER WILL BE.</h2>

<p>It is impossible to overestimate the benefits which
will accrue to mankind from such a creation. Flying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
will become a studied art, an amusement, an accomplishment,
and inconvenience from sultry heat, or freezing
cold, or deadly epidemics will no longer be suffered.
Flying will become a business, a trade, and the advantages
derived from it for industrial purposes will be wonderfully
great. New channels of employment will be
opened to thousands, yes, millions of starving fellow-beings.
A new era will be inaugurated in history;
and great as has been the destiny of our race, it will
be quite outlustred by the grandeur and magnitude of
coming events.</p>

<p>Traveling at a speed of over one hundred miles an
hour, distance will become comparatively annihilated.
Cutting through the air from San Francisco to New
York, for instance, in twenty-four hours, at one-sixth
in cost and time; far safer, because of no irregulations
nor obstructions of road, no snow-blockades or unnecessary
delays; far cheaper, because of no great expense
for outfit or maintenance, the ærial carriage will soon
become the great means of travel throughout the
world.</p>

<p>The vast uninhabited but productive regions of this
globe will be populated from overcrowded and impoverished
communities, because of the extraordinary
cheap, safe, and rapid travel by flying machines. New
life will again be imparted to enterprise, speculation
and labor; and lands will be cultivated and great cities
be built in regions where the foot of human being has
not trod for ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
The Andes and Rocky Mountains will become as
familiar to us as the hills of our own city; and mining
and other discoveries will follow each other with wonderful
rapidity. The vexing and expensive explorations
in the interiors of Africa and Australia, and towards
the North Pole, will soon be brought to a speedy
and satisfactory conclusion; and some of the wildest
dreams of men be realized.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI.&mdash;CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h2>

<p>The accomplishment of ærial navigation, then, is
within reach; its practicability can no longer be denied.
It will be one of the most glorious and fruitful conquests,
and of the highest value and importance to
civilized nations. But all inventions, and particularly
an undertaking of such gigantic nature, require pecuniary
assistance. This should not, in our age of progress,
be lacking for a single moment; because, if for no
other reason, the first promoters of it will reap such
great financial benefits therefrom as must be beyond
their calculation. Singer, Howe, Colt, McCormick,
and hundreds of others, all, with thousands of friends
so immensely wealthy, bear out this assertion. Let not
this enlightened age look upon a great invention as was
done in Robert Fulton's time, when he proposed the
steamship to Napoleon in 1801. The plan was laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
before a scientific commission, and these learned men
reported it as &quot;visionary&quot; and impracticable. Such
was the reception which steam navigation, that has
achieved such immense results, first received at the
hands of philosophy and capital; but France lost
thereby, indirectly, the control of Europe, and Napoleon
his crown; while another nation&mdash;America&mdash;more
wise, ten years later commenced to reap the benefits
emanating from Fulton's genius.</p>

<p>Means, then, being necessary for the accomplishment
of this great object, let them be forthcoming at once,
that California may enjoy the honor and the first fruits
of this great invention.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me thank you for the kind attention
you have bestowed upon a weak exponent of a
great subject.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
